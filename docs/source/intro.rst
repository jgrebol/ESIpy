The ESIpy program is aimed at the calculation of population analysis and aromaticity indicators from different
Hilbert-space partitions using the PySCF module. The program supports both restricted and unrestricted calculations for
single-determinant wavefunctions, and correlated wavefunctions from a restricted object (RHF). The atomic partitions
supported by the program are Mulliken, Löwdin, meta-Löwdin, Natural Atomic Orbitals (NAO), and Intrinsic Atomic Orbitals
(IAO).
